* The BLE client functionality referred to in footnote 6 has been added to `ESPHome 1.18.0 <https://esphome.io/changelog/v1.18.0.html>`_. This makes it possible to connect over Bluetooth Low Energy to a device and read characteristics such as the battery level or humidity. Have a look at the documentation of the `ESP32 BLE Client <https://esphome.io/components/ble_client.html>`_ and `BLE Sensor <https://esphome.io/components/sensor/ble_sensor.html>`_ components.
