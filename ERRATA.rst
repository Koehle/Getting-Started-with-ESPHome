These are corrections of errors found in the book `Getting Started with ESPHome <https://koen.vervloesem.eu/books/getting-started-with-esphome/>`_ only after its publication:

* In ESPHome 1.19, the order of the configuration file and the command has been changed in the command-line interface. So instead of ``esphome config.yaml run``, you now execute ``esphome run config.yaml``. The old format is still accepted for now, but will be removed in a future release.

Chapter 2: Preparing your ESPHome environment
*********************************************

* page 28: The ``--upload-port`` option has been renamed to ``--device`` in ESPHome 1.19.
* page 36: Make sure to add ``wifi`` and ``api`` components to the ``chapter2_substitutions.yaml`` file, otherwise the configuration doesn't compile. This is fixed `in the chapter2_substitutions.yaml file in this repository <https://github.com/koenvervloesem/Getting-Started-with-ESPHome/blob/main/esphome/chapter2_substitutions.yaml>`_.
